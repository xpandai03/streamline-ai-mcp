# YouTube Virality Detector - Vision & Product Specification

## Executive Summary

Build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that enables AI assistants like Claude to analyze YouTube videos and automatically identify viral-worthy moments. Users simply provide a YouTube URL, and the system returns timestamped clips with high viral potential, complete with hooks, scores, and explanations.

## Problem Statement

Content creators waste hours manually scrubbing through long-form videos to find shareable moments. They miss potential viral clips because:
- Manual review is time-consuming and tedious
- Human bias overlooks unexpected viral potential
- Lack of data-driven approach to content selection
- No systematic way to identify multiple clip opportunities

## Solution Vision

### Core Value Proposition
**"Turn any YouTube video into viral clips in minutes, not hours"**

An AI-powered tool that:
1. Takes a YouTube URL as input
2. Downloads and transcribes the full video
3. Analyzes content for viral potential using AI
4. Returns ranked, timestamped moments ready for clipping
5. Provides actionable insights on why each moment could go viral
