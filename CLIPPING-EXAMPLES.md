Tai Lopez is being sued by the Security
00:00:02.960
and Exchange Commission for allegedly
00:00:07.359
running a $112 million Ponzi scheme.
00:00:10.960
That's what they saying. I'm going to
00:00:12.559
talk about this, but to be clear, I am
00:00:14.880
super biased. I've known Tai for over 10
00:00:17.520
years. We've been friends. I actually
00:00:20.000
learned a lot from Tai. I'm going to
00:00:21.520
talk about it, but if you're looking for
00:00:22.880
a video where somebody just on Titus,
00:00:25.920
there's tons of videos that do that. I'm
00:00:27.840
just going to talk about what happened
00:00:28.960
and give you my perspective as somebody
00:00:30.800
who's known him for like 10 years.
00:00:32.000

Here's an article from CBS News. Buyer
00:00:35.440
of Radio Shack, Pier One importers, and
00:00:37.280
other brands accused of running a $112
00:00:39.360
million Ponzi scheme. Man, those are
00:00:40.960
strong. That's strong verbiage. And I
00:00:42.879
read through the actual complaint from
00:00:44.800
the Security Exchange Commission. Like,
00:00:46.239
I read through it. You can find it
00:00:47.760
online. And uh kind of just want to go
00:00:49.840
over what he's been accused of and just
00:00:52.480
my take on it, you know? So, listen,
00:00:54.480
here's the thing. So, the people who are
00:00:56.000
named in the lawsuit are one obviously
00:00:58.399
Tai Lopez. Another dude in one of his
00:01:00.480
business partners, uh, Alex Mir. Might
00:01:03.440
be saying his name wrong. I don't care.
00:01:04.879
I don't know. Alex and Maya Rose. I
00:01:07.360
don't know how to say Mia's last name,
00:01:08.640
but I'm going to call her Rose cuz I
00:01:09.920
think her name was Maya Rose before she
00:01:11.520
got married. So, I'm just going to keep
00:01:12.720
calling her that cuz that's how I
00:01:13.760
remember. And I I know Maya really well.
00:01:15.680
Like that's the homie. And uh, so what
00:01:17.520
they were doing, here's the thing. Check
00:01:18.000
No text
00:01:18.720
this out. I remember it might have been
00:01:20.320
10 years ago or so. You know, I I had
00:01:22.799
first met Tai and we became super cool.
00:01:24.880
I kick it with him when I'm in LA. I
00:01:27.040
holler at him. Uh we have videos on my
00:01:29.040
YouTube from like 10 years ago and he
00:01:31.360
would throw these events and he would
00:01:33.040
ask me to speak. He was like, "Yo, you
00:01:34.799
want to speak at this event?" All right,
00:01:35.680
cool, man. I come through in LA.
00:01:37.520
Sometimes if he had him in New York, I
00:01:38.960
was living in New York at the time. And
00:01:40.240
I I was like, "Yeah, I'll just pull up."
00:01:42.079
And obviously when I speak, I kind of
00:01:44.000
feel sorry for people that speak after
00:01:45.520
me because it's like, "Damn, man. I
00:01:47.520
ain't mean to be this good. There's no
00:01:49.360
way you can follow up with that." But I
00:01:51.439
would speak all the time and at the end
00:01:53.119
of all these events, he would say,
00:01:54.560
"Listen, if you're an accredited
00:01:56.079
investor, then I'd like to talk to you
00:01:58.320
privately." And he would do this for
00:01:59.920
years. So while I was at these events,
00:02:01.439
it was years. He was just gathering
00:02:03.040
accredited investors. Now, what's an
00:02:05.119
accredited investor? That means you're
00:02:07.439
earning over $200,000 a year or having a
00:02:10.479
net worth of over $1 million, right? And
00:02:12.560
when you're accredited investor, you can
00:02:14.000
No text
00:02:14.319
invest in certain things. The SEC allows
00:02:16.239
you to make investments that aren't
00:02:17.920
available to the general public. If I'm
00:02:19.680
not mistaken, a lot of that happened in
00:02:21.840
'08 after uh when they did Wall Street
00:02:24.640
reform in order to try to protect
00:02:26.879
investors. He would gather up all these
00:02:28.480
accredited investors and take them in
00:02:30.080
the back. And I didn't know what he was
00:02:31.520
talking about because I was taking
00:02:33.840
pictures with fans and [ __ ] You know
00:02:35.519
what I'm saying? So, and I never went
00:02:37.280
back there cuz it was like whatever. I
00:02:39.040
was an accredited investor, but I was
00:02:41.040
just like, nah, I was focused on what I
00:02:43.120
was doing, right? I didn't know why what
00:02:44.879
he was doing with these accredited
00:02:46.000
investors. I would just see him going to
00:02:47.120
the back and then I would go do some
00:02:48.319
other [ __ ] you know, like take pictures
00:02:50.239
with fans, holl at the hoes, all that
00:02:51.680
other [ __ ] right? What happened was he
00:02:53.000
No text
00:02:53.120
was starting a private equity fund, man.
00:02:54.720
And it was called Retail E-commerce
00:02:57.360
Ventures or Rev. And I remember when he
00:03:00.640
made his first purchase, man, he bought
00:03:02.080
this [ __ ] called Dress Barn. And Ty text
00:03:04.319
me, he's like, "Yo, I just bought Dress
00:03:05.680
Barn." I was like, "Yo, that's what's
00:03:06.800
up, man. What's Dress Barn?" I didn't
00:03:08.560
know what it was, man. I don't know
00:03:10.080
which one of y'all's out here [ __ ]
00:03:11.519
you [ __ ] who shop at Dress Barn. But
00:03:13.840
it's the thing. Then he told me he was
00:03:15.120
like, "Yo, man, I just bought linens and
00:03:16.959
things." All right. Again, this the
00:03:18.239
homie, right? So, like, text me. Uh, I
00:03:20.640
remember he bought Radio Shack, Pier One
00:03:22.560
Imports. I'm like, "Yo, this
00:03:23.000
No text
00:03:23.519
[ __ ] doing his thing, man. He's
00:03:25.200
a genius." You know, the online
00:03:27.760
influencer/guru
00:03:29.760
space. Like, that's one thing, but I was
00:03:31.440
like, "Oh [ __ ] he's ascended to like
00:03:33.440
another level of entrepreneur." Like the
00:03:35.680
highest level like private equity,
00:03:37.599
that's like a high level of
00:03:39.040
entrepreneur. I remember it was during
00:03:40.799
the the pandemic. I'm talking to him
00:03:43.280
like via text and he's like, "Yo man,
00:03:46.480
just bought Modell's." Those yall don't
00:03:48.720
know Modell's. Modell's was a sporting
00:03:50.480
good store. I think it was only in New
00:03:52.159
York. It might have been so I never seen
00:03:53.840
a Modell's in another part of the
00:03:55.200
country, but they used to have the song
00:03:57.120
got to go to Mo Modell. And I guess they
00:04:00.640
went out of business and sold to Tai.
00:04:02.480
And I was like, "Oh [ __ ] I [ __ ] with
00:04:03.840
Modell's man. I bought some Jordans out
00:04:05.519
of there before." And he was like, "Yo,
00:04:07.200
you want to get in on this deal, man?"
00:04:08.560
And I was like, man, I want to, but I'm
00:04:11.120
getting divorced right now. And the
00:04:12.959
lawyer said, don't buy nothing [ __ ]
00:04:14.560
because they going to take it. So I was
00:04:17.519
like, yo, I got to wait till all this
00:04:18.798
[ __ ] is over. You know what I'm saying?
00:04:20.000
But I wanted to get into Modell [ __ ] I
00:04:22.079
did because he was like, yo, man, we can
00:04:23.680
do some [ __ ] like make you the face of
00:04:25.120
Modell's. And I was excited to do it. I
00:04:27.199
was going to put up like a meal for
00:04:29.199
Modell. I just I just couldn't because
00:04:30.639
of divorce. Now, that ended up being
00:04:33.600
good. You know, this might be the first
00:04:35.759
time in history a nigga's ex-wife saved
00:04:38.639
him some money. He's someone I talk to
00:04:40.000
No text
00:04:40.400
all the time. Every time I see him sub,
00:04:41.919
we got a bunch of mutual friends. That's
00:04:43.360
the only I'm going show you what he's
00:04:44.560
accused of, right? But again, these are
00:04:46.400
just accusations, right? And but we're
00:04:48.240
going to go over I read the whole
00:04:50.080
complaint. I'm going to go over this
00:04:51.520
[ __ ] line line by line, but what he's
00:04:53.280
accused of. So, one of the first thing
00:04:54.960
according to the SEC, they were
00:04:57.040
promising return on investment of 25% a
00:05:00.160
year or something like that, right?
00:05:01.120
They're saying that they were using the
00:05:03.040
new investors money to pay the dividends
00:05:05.680
to the older investors. If true would be
00:05:06.000
No text
00:05:07.759
a Ponzi scheme. Here's why I don't
00:05:09.360
believe it. And this is for me. Like I
00:05:10.880
don't know that I I don't have no
00:05:12.240
affiliation with Rev. You know, I never
00:05:14.479
invested. Just Tai's the homie. But
00:05:16.240
Tai's like really the homie. Like I
00:05:18.000
don't think he would have asked me to
00:05:19.680
invest if he thought I was going to get
00:05:21.440
ripped off. And and I know I'm biased so
00:05:23.440
you might think differently and I I'd
00:05:25.600
understand that. Like that's really my
00:05:27.440
dog. I I really don't think he would
00:05:28.960
have asked me to to uh invest if it was
00:05:31.039
a Ponzi scheme. So, the SEC is going to
00:05:32.639
have to prove that that that's true,
00:05:34.240
right? Again, everyone's innocent until
00:05:35.919
proven guilty. That's one count, Ponzi
00:05:38.080
scheming. But they're also accused of
00:05:40.000
inappropriately comingling funds.
00:05:42.000
No text
00:05:42.960
They're accused of transferring one
00:05:45.120
money from one account to another
00:05:46.400
account, like taking the Radio Shack
00:05:48.000
money to pay for the dress barn [ __ ]
00:05:49.759
and you're not necessarily supposed to
00:05:51.039
do that. So, for example, what the SEC
00:05:53.039
is accusing him of is like, let's say
00:05:54.639
you invest you invested in some Radio
00:05:56.240
Shack, but they took your Radio Shack
00:05:58.080
money and paid Brandon Carter to be on
00:06:00.000
the Modell's billboard. You know what
00:06:01.520
I'm saying? That would have been a wise
00:06:03.039
investment. You're not supposed to do
00:06:04.400
that. According to Security Exchange
00:06:06.000
Commission, they're also accused of
00:06:08.400
misappropriation of investor funds. They
00:06:10.960
trying to say that uh Tai and Alex
00:06:13.919
diverted $16 million of investor funds
00:06:17.199
for their own personal use uh with no
00:06:19.680
apparent business purpose. The reason I
00:06:21.840
don't think that's true is cuz Tai was
00:06:24.479
rich. Like rich rich. When Tai was on
00:06:26.880
his social media run, if I told y'all
00:06:28.720
how much money he was making, I don't
00:06:30.400
think you would believe it. But he was
00:06:32.240
making like some serious [ __ ] money,
00:06:34.400
bro. And I don't think he needed 16 mil
00:06:36.880
that bad from what I know. Like straight
00:06:38.639
up. So, I think the SEC is going to have
00:06:42.080
a difficult time proving that. Remember,
00:06:44.560
I knew him from before the here in my
00:06:46.639
garage ad came out and he was already
00:06:48.720
rich. He's also being accused of false
00:06:51.039
claims of success and profitability. I
00:06:53.759
can't speak to this cuz I don't know the
00:06:55.039
inner workings of the businesses or
00:06:57.680
everything, but basically they're saying
00:06:59.360
that the [ __ ] was profitable when it
00:07:01.000
No text
00:07:01.039
wasn't. That's what the SEC is trying to
00:07:02.479
say. I can't speak to that. Tai never
00:07:04.400
lied to me about nothing. That's all I
00:07:06.240
can say. you know, everyone's innocent
00:07:07.599
and proven guilty, right? And then, um,
00:07:09.599
another one is false claims of payment
00:07:12.560
reliability, right? So, the SEC is
00:07:16.479
trying to say that the defendants, uh,
00:07:18.400
assured investors orally, Paul, and in
00:07:22.080
written material that Rev and other Rev
00:07:25.199
retailer brands never missed a payment
00:07:27.280
to a single investor, but SEC is saying
00:07:29.759
that [ __ ] ain't true. They're going to
00:07:30.800
have to prove, they're going to make
00:07:31.680
their case, you know. I I don't know. I
00:07:33.520
didn't invest cuz I I couldn't at the
00:07:35.120
time. I was tied up in my own
00:07:36.720
litigation. I was in family court. And
00:07:39.199
here's the one that I know they're going
00:07:40.639
to beat. They also being accused of
00:07:43.120
misrepresenting um Maya's experience cuz
00:07:46.319
you know they they had her on a public
00:07:48.160
website saying that she had 10 years
00:07:50.400
experience managing multi-million dollar
00:07:52.240
companies. But they're saying, "Nah,
00:07:53.759
man. This chick was just a [ __ ]
00:07:55.520
kindergarten teacher and a radio disc
00:07:57.599
jockey or some shit." That's what SEC is
00:07:59.520
trying to say. I know that's not cool
00:08:00.960
because when I would go kicking with
00:08:02.000
No text
00:08:02.240
Tai, Maya was always there and Maya was
00:08:04.879
like running [ __ ] right? I've done
00:08:06.240
business with Tai successfully. He paid
00:08:08.080
me. I know that. And uh a lot of that
00:08:10.960
[ __ ] had to go through Maya. Like she
00:08:12.400
was really running that [ __ ] They
00:08:13.759
should easily beat that. I remember
00:08:15.599
thinking cuz when I was running my
00:08:17.599
business at the time, I was like, man, I
00:08:19.199
need a [ __ ] like Maya on my team
00:08:21.199
cuz she's on top of [ __ ] She's super
00:08:22.879
smart and she running [ __ ] you know?
00:08:24.240
It's not what Brandon Carter believes is
00:08:26.240
what you can prove in court, you know?
00:08:27.599
But they should be able to prove that
00:08:29.440
[ __ ] And Maya is also accused of aiding
00:08:31.759
and abetting Lopez and Myrr violations.
00:08:35.599
Honestly, I don't know what went on with
00:08:37.279
Rev. I hope a jury finds him innocent,
00:08:40.000
No text
00:08:40.000
you know, cuz that's my dog. Now,
00:08:41.679
investors, I guess, but potentially lost
00:08:44.000
money, but you know, that can happen,
00:08:45.760
you know, and if if Tai didn't do
00:08:47.760
nothing wrong, hey, that's just what it
00:08:49.200
is, you know, and the SEC's it's it's
00:08:51.680
their job to prove if he did something
00:08:52.959
wrong or not.
00:08:55.450

COMPETITORS VIRAL CLIPS:

1) CLIP TRANSCRIPT:
Of so one of the first thing according to the sec they were promising return on investment of 25 a year or something like that right they're saying that they were using the new investors money to pay the dividends to the older investors if true would be a policy scheme here's why i don't believe it just for me like i don't know i don't have no affiliation with rev you know i never invested just ties the homie but ties like really the homie like i don't think he would have asked me to invest if he thought i was going to get ripped off and i know i'm biased so you might think differently and i i'd understand that like that's really my dog.
I really don't think he would have asked me to invest if it was a policy scheme so the sec is going to have to prove that that that's true right.
Again everyone's innocent until proven guilty.

2) CLIP TRANSCRPT:
Right what happened was he was starting a private equity fund man and it was called retail e -commerce ventures or rev and i remember when he made his first purchase man he bought this shit called dress barn and ty texted me he's like yo i just bought dress barn.

I'm like yo this motherfucker doing this thing man he's a genius.
You know the online influencer slash guru space like that's one thing but i was like oh shit he's ascended to like another level of entrepreneur like the highest level like private equity that's like a high level of entrepreneur.

3) CLIP TRANCRIPT:
At the end of all these events he would say listen if you're an accredited investor then i'd like to talk to you privately and he would do this for years.
So while i was at these events it was years he was just gathering accredited investors.
Now what's an accredited investor that means you're earning over two hundred thousand dollars a year or having a net worth of over one million dollars right.
And when you're an accredited investor you can invest in certain things the sec allows you to make investments that aren't available to the general public.
If i'm not mistaken a lot of that happened in 08 after uh when they did wall street reform in order to try to protect investors.

00:00:00.000
The fastest growing team in network
00:00:01.280
marketing have replaced old school
00:00:03.120
prospecting with AI systems. While most
00:00:05.520
people waste hours chasing prospects and
00:00:07.440
doing endless Zoom calls, AI is
00:00:09.280
prospecting and converting prospects
00:00:10.719
from social media, helping new team
00:00:12.480
members launch their business and get
00:00:13.920
into their first enrollments within 6 to
00:00:16.000
10 days. And AI is helping drive deep
00:00:18.400
duplication in large organizations, all
00:00:20.800
while everybody else is sleeping. I've
00:00:22.640
literally helped thousands of network
00:00:24.400
marketers move past cold DMs,
00:00:26.480
prospecting strangers, using outdated
00:00:28.560
social media tactics that don't work,
00:00:30.320
and help to move them into top earner
00:00:32.558
status in this space. And when you see
00:00:34.640
this, you'll never work your business
00:00:36.480
the same way ever again. In this video,
00:00:38.719
I'll show you how to start building AI
00:00:40.559
powered enrollment and duplication
00:00:42.000
systems that work 24/7 while others burn
00:00:44.559
out trying to keep up. The fact of the
00:00:46.320
matter is the industry is splitting in
00:00:48.320
two. Old school, which is still teaching
00:00:50.239
outdated tactics. make a list of 100
00:00:52.239
cold DM home parties and even a lot of
00:00:54.800
social media tactics that are no longer
00:00:56.640
working. And then there's the new school
00:00:58.480
world who are the early adopters using
00:01:00.640
AI systems to attract, automate, and
00:01:02.480
duplicate. Less than 1% of network
00:01:04.479
marketers are actually using AI tools
00:01:06.400
effectively. And it's not about being
00:01:07.920
techy. It's about being efficient and
00:01:10.080
having AI implement on your behalf 10
00:01:12.799
times better than you can today using
00:01:15.439
only your words. Now, I know a little
00:01:17.680
bit about this because I'm actually an
00:01:19.680
MIT graduate. I went to MIT as an
00:01:21.680
undergrad and studied computer science.
00:01:23.520
I studied AI. And honestly, it was one
00:01:26.320
of the most boring classes and topics
00:01:28.159
that I ever took. I was convinced that
00:01:30.479
AI would never be a thing because of how
00:01:32.320
primitive it was at the time. It was
00:01:34.400
really, really disappointing. And even
00:01:36.079
when Chat GPT came online a few years
00:01:38.079
ago, it still couldn't write social
00:01:39.759
media posts or create marketing content
00:01:41.840
as well as I could. And so I thought,
00:01:43.600
well, at least it gives us a starting
00:01:45.520
point and allows us to kind of get 50
00:01:47.840
60% of the way there. And then earlier
00:01:49.600
this year, I learned how to create
00:01:50.960
custom AIs. And one of the first things
00:01:52.960
I did was I gave it a bunch of info
00:01:54.479
about my business. Gave it some
00:01:56.240
knowledge, some training, and some
00:01:57.680
resources that I put together for my
00:01:59.600
students and my team. And I had it write
00:02:01.680
a video script for me. And after it gave
00:02:04.240
me the script, my jaw literally dropped.
00:02:06.640
I had to admit to myself that it
00:02:08.560
actually wrote this script better than I
00:02:10.318
could have done it, even if I had weeks
00:02:11.920
to craft it. And then I started testing
00:02:13.599
other things. I got really excited. I
00:02:15.520
was like, how can it perform with social
00:02:17.200
media posts or ads? The verdict, way
00:02:19.360
better and way faster. How about Rios
00:02:21.200
and Tik Tok videos and ideas and scripts
00:02:23.520
and caption content for lead generation?
00:02:25.599
Well, way better, way faster. And I was
00:02:27.920
shocked as to just the quality of
00:02:30.080
content and the creativity that it
00:02:31.599
produced. And then I was like, let's see
00:02:32.879
if an AI can help my team members or my
00:02:35.280
students respond to prospects by just
00:02:37.280
having the AI read Messenger
00:02:39.040
conversation and tell my student or my
00:02:41.120
team members how to respond to that
00:02:42.720
prospects. And so I fed it some
00:02:44.239
training. I fed it some information that
00:02:46.080
would kind of guide it. And again, blown
00:02:48.160
away. It can literally help a new person
00:02:51.120
or an experienced person respond very
00:02:53.120
effectively to prospects that are in
00:02:54.800
Messenger and get them over the line. It
00:02:56.560
was pretty mind-blowing. And then
00:02:57.840
building team duplication systems and
00:02:59.760
automation. What used to take months in
00:03:02.080
terms of building those systems now
00:03:03.840
could actually be done in 30 minutes or
00:03:05.440
less. And the thing I was really blown
00:03:07.280
away by was having AI actually coach a
00:03:10.560
new team member through anything. Like
00:03:12.800
it is now possible to actually create a
00:03:14.480
custom AI that can coach your team 247,
00:03:17.200
hold their hand with the patience of a
00:03:18.800
Canadian and you not be involved at all.
00:03:21.120
If they have questions about where to
00:03:22.400
find a certain resource, the AI can
00:03:24.080
help. If they have a question on how to
00:03:25.519
write a social media post for a certain
00:03:27.200
purpose, the AI will do it better than
00:03:28.959
they can though. It was truly
00:03:31.200
mind-blowing. And so before I show you
00:03:33.120
the seeds AI systems that we use, I want
00:03:35.680
to go deeper as to what's possible
00:03:37.280
because this is what AI can unlock for
00:03:39.040
you. Here's what your business starts to
00:03:40.720
look like. So let's first talk about AI
00:03:42.879
powered social media content. Now we all
00:03:44.879
know that with social media consistency
00:03:46.560
and value builds trust, right? But
00:03:48.239
creating content daily is hard, requires
00:03:50.400
a lot of discipline, especially if
00:03:52.080
you're new. Well, the pre-trained custom
00:03:54.480
AI tools will literally ask a new person
00:03:57.040
questions about their background, target
00:03:58.879
audience, their business, and then
00:04:01.120
brainstorm and write posts, generate
00:04:03.200
images, and create viral reels and Tik
00:04:05.120
Tok videos literally in seconds. Even if
00:04:07.439
the person that is interacting with AI
00:04:09.680
has zero social media experience or zero
00:04:11.760
network marketing experience, and I'm
00:04:13.519
not talking about giving you prompts or
00:04:15.599
you giving your new team members
00:04:16.880
prompts. I'm talking about an AI tool
00:04:18.880
that actually prompts you and can ask
00:04:20.880
you questions and knows exactly what to
00:04:23.040
do with that information without you
00:04:25.199
having to know anything about prompts.
00:04:26.800
One of our students, Candace, generated
00:04:28.320
over $5,500 in product sales from her
00:04:30.800
first three social media posts ever on
00:04:32.960
her personal profile, and the content
00:04:34.560
was AI generated. or Helen, a leader
00:04:36.960
who's gone viral on Tik Tok and reels
00:04:38.800
with videos between 300,000 to 1.1
00:04:41.680
million views. AI is actually a big part
00:04:43.840
of how she gets 30 days of content done
00:04:46.320
in a single hour per month. Now, let's
00:04:48.960
talk about social media automations
00:04:50.800
because now that's possible with social
00:04:52.880
automations. Instead of chasing leads,
00:04:54.720
AI helps you attract and pre-qualify
00:04:56.800
them while you sleep. And this is not
00:04:58.639
just about content creation or
00:05:00.560
generation. AI can literally reply to
00:05:02.800
social media comments, initiate
00:05:04.400
conversations with interested prospects
00:05:05.840
in Messenger and actually have
00:05:07.520
full-blown sales conversations at a high
00:05:10.320
skill level with prospects and close
00:05:12.320
them for you or even book them on your
00:05:14.240
calendar automatically without you doing
00:05:16.240
anything. For example, one of our
00:05:17.840
clients, Brandon, he had a video go
00:05:19.919
viral on reals that generated over 3,475
00:05:23.919
comments. automation replied to every
00:05:26.160
single comment, interacted and exchanged
00:05:28.639
messages in Messenger, and he was able
00:05:31.120
to convert over,300 leads to his email
00:05:34.320
and SMS list for follow-up. Two weeks
00:05:36.800
into the process, has closed 10 life
00:05:38.960
insurance deals so far. Or another
00:05:41.199
student, Julie Warner, who's leaned into
00:05:43.199
automation fully and has grown an email
00:05:45.039
list of 6,700 leads over the past year,
00:05:48.160
generated over 422 customers on
00:05:50.400
autopilot, and has built a six-figure
00:05:52.560
business in record speed. Or let's talk
00:05:54.479
about AI powered duplication systems.
00:05:56.560
Imagine all the things you're constantly
00:05:58.080
finding yourself repeating over and over
00:05:59.680
again to your team and all that gets
00:06:01.520
handled by AI. Or onboarding a new team
00:06:04.080
member, getting them started, giving
00:06:05.280
them the lay of the land, helping them
00:06:06.880
in launching their business and telling
00:06:08.240
them exactly what to do. Imagine all of
00:06:10.240
that being handled by AI. How much time
00:06:12.479
would that save you? How much of your
00:06:13.840
time could you recoup? I'm guessing
00:06:15.600
probably about 80% of your time that you
00:06:17.680
spend coaching is probably spent
00:06:19.680
repeating yourself. Or let's say you
00:06:21.440
having an AI with knowledge of the team
00:06:23.600
systems across the profession can
00:06:26.000
literally look into the businesses of
00:06:27.440
other people who are successfully
00:06:28.560
building online and making
00:06:30.080
recommendations for you on how to update
00:06:32.000
your system, enhance it, fix whatever is
00:06:34.319
wrong with it or not working. For
00:06:35.759
example, one of our students, Beexadak,
00:06:37.440
went from being an overwhelmed
00:06:38.639
six-figure earner ready to quit due to
00:06:40.720
burnout to a multiple seven figure
00:06:42.479
earner with a team of over 180,000
00:06:44.479
people. And it's all due to our systems.
00:06:46.479
and she's actually one of the first
00:06:47.759
leaders in all of network marketing to
00:06:49.520
actually build a custom AI support
00:06:50.960
system for her team, which has instantly
00:06:53.360
freed up her time. Or Megan, who rebuilt
00:06:55.840
a multiple six-figure business in nine
00:06:57.440
months after leaving her old company and
00:06:59.360
starting a new, hitting diamond in
00:07:00.960
record speed because she had these
00:07:02.240
systems and was also leveraging a custom
00:07:04.800
AI to support her team and answer their
00:07:06.960
questions. You're no longer just
00:07:08.479
prospecting or doing the old stuff.
00:07:10.240
You're building a system that does a lot
00:07:12.000
of the thinking and heavy lifting for
00:07:13.440
you, converts prospects and holds their
00:07:15.919
hand as they get started with you and
00:07:17.759
gets them into predictable results right
00:07:20.080
away, even if they have zero social
00:07:21.919
media or network marketing experience
00:07:23.919
without you being involved at all. The
00:07:26.080
main reason network marketers are not
00:07:27.599
using AI is simply due to a lack of
00:07:29.680
understanding. If what I'm sharing makes
00:07:31.520
sense and you're thinking it's time for
00:07:32.880
you to use AI in your business and
00:07:34.479
leverage modern strategies and systems,
00:07:36.319
I'd love to help you. We've helped
00:07:38.080
thousands of network marketers implement
00:07:39.680
our proprietary self-generating
00:07:41.599
enrollment and duplication systems AIS
00:07:43.680
or seeds to attract prospects on social
00:07:45.919
media, launch lead genen systems, and
00:07:48.080
build team duplication systems without
00:07:50.000
the constant hustle rejection or
00:07:51.440
burnout. So, just click the link in the
00:07:53.039
description to schedule your strategy
00:07:54.800
session. Okay, so what we're going to do
00:07:56.080
right now is I'm going to start you on
00:07:57.840
your AI quick start plan. And this is a
00:08:00.080
way for you to be able to implement a
00:08:01.759
social media strategy or a recruiting
00:08:03.599
strategy and be able to do it and
00:08:05.680
execute it at a higher level than you
00:08:07.680
can right now. This is literally like
00:08:09.039
going to your future self and having
00:08:10.800
your future self a year or two from now
00:08:12.720
implement something on your behalf. And
00:08:14.560
we're going to use this dirty AI method
00:08:16.639
which isn't that dirty, but it's pretty
00:08:17.919
fast and anyone could do it. So step
00:08:19.680
number one is you need a chat account. I
00:08:21.840
recommend a plus membership. It's 20
00:08:23.440
bucks a month. Highly worth it for what
00:08:25.440
you're able to get out of it. So that's
00:08:26.720
step number one. You use chat. Step
00:08:28.560
number two is you want to gather
00:08:30.160
documents, training documents on
00:08:31.680
whatever you're currently learning. And
00:08:33.279
the more information the better. If you
00:08:34.640
can get video transcripts, awesome slide
00:08:36.479
handouts given to you that's in a PDF,
00:08:38.240
any sample script, if it's some sort of
00:08:40.080
prospecting, how to talk to prospects
00:08:42.159
training. And these are things that your
00:08:43.760
upline or a mentor you might be working
00:08:45.440
with is giving you as part of their
00:08:47.279
training. Hopefully, they're giving you
00:08:48.480
some documents that will guide you.
00:08:50.000
That's what you can actually put into
00:08:51.360
AI. And so you're going to take those
00:08:52.959
documents and then you're going to go
00:08:54.399
into chatbt on the left side and click
00:08:56.560
on new project on the left sidebar.
00:08:58.720
You're going to name the project and
00:09:00.160
under add files there's a button there
00:09:02.320
upload these documents. The documents
00:09:04.080
need to be in text format, word document
00:09:06.240
or PDF. Don't do any other formats. And
00:09:09.040
the goal here is to basically train the
00:09:11.440
AI with these documents. Now, the next
00:09:14.160
thing is once you're in the project and
00:09:15.920
you've done this on the top right of
00:09:17.519
your screen or your browser, you're
00:09:19.279
going to see a symbol that's literally
00:09:21.440
just three dots. It almost is invisible,
00:09:23.360
but it's there. Click on that and select
00:09:25.519
edit instructions after you click on it.
00:09:27.600
Here, you're going to tell the AI to
00:09:29.440
study the documents you just gave it.
00:09:31.600
And you want to actually explain to it
00:09:33.680
in as much detail as possible what you
00:09:36.000
want it to help you with. If you're
00:09:37.600
wanting help with social media, tell it
00:09:39.279
that you need to write social media
00:09:40.880
posts for Rios or Tik Tok or whatever
00:09:42.720
format or ask it how to respond to a
00:09:44.800
prospect that you need help responding
00:09:46.560
to prospects and you want to train it
00:09:47.920
and these are the documents that your
00:09:49.519
upline or your mentor gave you on how to
00:09:51.279
effectively do that. Or you can tell it
00:09:53.360
to give you a script for reaching out to
00:09:55.360
warm prospects. You can even start a new
00:09:57.600
chat in that project and ask it to write
00:09:59.760
the instructions for itself and copy and
00:10:02.320
paste that into the edit instructions
00:10:04.320
area. After some testing, you should be
00:10:06.399
good to go and you can create as many of
00:10:08.080
these projects as you want. Now, at this
00:10:10.240
point, you basically have created a
00:10:11.839
specially trained AI to help you with
00:10:13.920
whatever the documents were about.
00:10:16.000
Basically, an AI assistant specializing
00:10:18.079
in what you might not be able to do at a
00:10:20.000
high level right now. But AI is a quick
00:10:22.399
study of whatever training documents you
00:10:24.480
give it. Plus, it has access to the
00:10:26.079
internet and has this massive repository
00:10:28.079
of knowledge. And this is a quick and
00:10:29.920
dirty yet highly effective way for you
00:10:32.000
to be able to implement at a high skill
00:10:34.000
level what you may not be able to do
00:10:36.079
right now. Now, the next step is
00:10:38.320
choosing to be a professional. While
00:10:40.000
this approach may help you implement
00:10:41.760
something at a more advanced skill level
00:10:43.600
than you currently do it on your own, do
00:10:45.600
all you can to learn the skill yourself.
00:10:47.920
Sometimes AI does hallucinate or
00:10:49.839
misunderstand things. The input also
00:10:52.000
matters. If you are giving it documents
00:10:54.079
and instructions on, let's say, doing
00:10:55.600
old school network marketing, then
00:10:57.120
that's what it's going to give you. It's
00:10:58.320
going to have you implement something at
00:10:59.600
a high level, but it's still old school
00:11:01.600
and probably won't be as fun even if
00:11:03.519
you're using AI to produce that content.
00:11:05.360
If you want to earn a professional six
00:11:06.959
and seven figure income, then you need
00:11:08.320
to learn a professional six and seven
00:11:10.399
figure skill set. And you can enhance it
00:11:12.480
with AI while you're ramping up. It's
00:11:14.800
critical that you learn a more modern
00:11:16.240
approach to building a network marketing
00:11:17.519
business and use AI to help you
00:11:19.360
implement at a higher skill level while
00:11:21.519
you're learning the skills. And this can
00:11:23.120
include setting up systems and
00:11:24.399
automation for your business. But you
00:11:26.000
don't want to wait to start using AI.
00:11:27.680
The worst thing you can do is wait six
00:11:29.680
months to start because the people who
00:11:31.360
start now are already building momentum
00:11:33.360
while others are literally burning out.
00:11:35.120
AI isn't here to replace you. It's here
00:11:37.040
to replace the parts of your business
00:11:38.560
that are slowing you down, even if that
00:11:40.640
part is literally the fact that you're a
00:11:42.320
newbie and you don't have the skills
00:11:44.079
yet. And the network marketers who adapt
00:11:46.000
now will dominate in this next era. If
00:11:48.160
you're ready to start implementing these
00:11:49.519
AI strategies in your business, book a
